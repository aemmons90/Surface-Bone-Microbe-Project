Microbial colonization of bone is an important mechanism of post-mortem skeletal degradation. However, the types and distributions of bone 
and tooth colonizing microbes are not well characterized. It is unknown if microbial communities vary in abundance or composition between 
bone element types, which could help explain patterns of human DNA preservation. The goals of this research were to (1) identify the types 
of microbes capable of colonizing different human bone types and (2) relate microbial abundances, diversity, and community composition to 
bone type and human DNA preservation. 

Types of data found in this repository:
1. Code for sequencing analysis using cutadapt, trimmomatic, and mothur: 16S rRNA
2. Code for sequencing analysis using cutadapt, trimmomatic, and mothur: 18S rRNA
3. R Code and associated files---metadata was modified slightly for upload to protect donor information and eliminate extraneous information. Because of this, some of the code may need slight modifications.
4. Metadata including sample codes, donor information, DNA concentrations (human, total, total bacterial).
